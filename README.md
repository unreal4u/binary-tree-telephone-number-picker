This is a test script made for the lol during lunch to get to know how hard it
actually would be to create a script that will calculate your phone number
(I know, in Dutch format only) based on a binary tree search.

It was a nice exercise and things could probably improve a lot, but as I said,
this was just made for the lol and nothing in here adheres to best practices
or other stuff I would do in a more serious environment. Enjoy!
